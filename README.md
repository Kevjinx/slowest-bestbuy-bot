Want to emphasize again, this is the SLOWEST bot you can use. I built this just to play around with the selenium api. This bot will unlikely get the items you can to get your hands on.

HOWEVER...

I do plan on learning more about selenium and will be updating the performance of the bot and possibly use python to multithread when I start learning it.
